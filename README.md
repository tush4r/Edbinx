# EdBinx iOS App on Swift 3
EdBinx is a technology blog, and is for people like you and me. People who are always connected with their technology, expanding its limits, programming day in and day out. We love our jobs, but as soon as we encounter a bug, we are stuck. We start searching through Google, and after scrolling and reading through hundreds of pages we land on something that can produce fruitful results. Something that can help others as well. EdBinx is all about pushing out solutions to such bugs, new tricks and tips, and much more in a simple and easy to read format. Helping fellow geeks has its bliss.

This repository is for Swift 3 iOS app of EdBinx.
